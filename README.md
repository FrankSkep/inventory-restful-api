## Description

RESTful API for inventory management, designed to handle products, suppliers, categories, stock movements, and notifications. It uses JWT-based authentication to manage permissions and roles and integrates cloud services like **Cloudinary** for image management.

Includes a **global exception handler** that ensures consistent responses for common errors (authentication, validation, data not found, etc.).

## Features

### Authentication and Authorization

- User registration and login.
- JWT token generation and validation.
- Endpoint protection by roles (`USER`, `MOD`, and `ADMIN`).
- Specific exception handling (invalid token, unauthorized access).

### Products

- Full CRUD for products with pagination and filters.
- Image management via **Cloudinary**.
- PDF reports of the current inventory.
- Association with suppliers and categories.

### Categories

- Full CRUD for categories.
- Hierarchical relationship with products.

### Suppliers

- Full CRUD for suppliers.
- Association with products.

### Movements

- Registration of stock entries and exits.
- Export reports in PDF format.
- Alerts for low stock.

### Notifications

- Centralized notification management.
- System to mark as read or delete them.

### Global Exceptions

- Centralized error handling in:
  - Data validation.
  - Authentication and authorization.
  - Resources not found.
  - Forbidden operations.

## Architecture

The API uses a modular design based on RESTful controllers, business services, and repositories.

### Main Technologies:
- **Spring Boot**: Main framework for the application.
- **JWT**: Authentication and authorization.
- **Spring Security**: Role management and endpoint protection.
- **MySQL**: Relational database.
- **Cloudinary**: Cloud image storage.
